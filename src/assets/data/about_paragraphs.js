In 2008 I studied Reiki, earning a certificate in the Usui System of Natural Healing from Master Reiki Tamara Soboleva, enabling me to bring the Japanese healing system methods of Reiki to my sessions. That next year in 2009, I earned my Master Myoskeletal Therapist certification from Eric Dalton, Phd, learning techniques of Myoskeletal Alignment for neck, sciatic, and leg pains. I have also completed a course learning Lomilomi in 2019, a traditional Hawaiian technique that relaxes muscles, releases tension, and promotes well-being. "
